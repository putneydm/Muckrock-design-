				<p>The facts are murky, the implications dire. My source, a reliable one, tells me this: In 1952, the U.S. Military appears to have commissioned a report from Duke University's Durham NC School of Medicine y (Author: E. Markee) on ExtraSensory Perception in Dogs. The final report was 16 pages. Sixteen pages that have never been, as far as I can tell, released publicly.</p>

				<p>We now have official confirmation of the report's existence. 16 pages that are, as of now, being held and <a href="">reviewed by the Army</a> Public Affairs Office.</p>

				<p>The request is now overdue by two months. We implore you, Army Public Affairs Office: Free this report. Free our (dogs') minds.</p>
