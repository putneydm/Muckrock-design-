					<p>Hi,</p>
					<p>It looks that you're request is currently being processed. It usually takes agencies a few weeks to do a complete search, so just get comfy: There's nothing else you need to do but wait at this point.</p>

<p>This is an odd answer, for sure -- I don't see why another requester's capacity has any bearing on your own. However, in my experience the FBI does not charge fees when requested documents have already been processed for another requester. I don't think this is an indication that the FBI plans to charge you, but that they've already waived fees in another request so they're not going to do so for you. </p>

<p>Anyone have a different read?</p>
