					<p>Surveillance footage is a government record like anything else.  The only major problem would be privacy issues.  If the agency does not know the identity of the people in the footage, it has to redact them, which for video is a more time-consuming and expensive process.</p>

<p>At least in California -- you can access it. In the past, I've requested video surveillance footage of a crime that occurred in downtown San Diego. It was captured by the local transportation agency's camera outside a trolley station. I also just requested surveillance footage from the same agency of footage from buses and trolleys. They appear to be honoring that request, as well.</p>

<blockquote>The problem is, a lot of times these government agencies use third-party software. So when you request the footage, the files may come in a format you've never seen or heard of and you'll have to scrounge around for a way to play them.</blockquote>

<p>To request, simply file a Public Records Act request for the footage. But keep in mind they do re-use a lot of the tapes if there is no reason to keep them, so only footage of crimes would be kept. Daily activity would not last for more than a couple weeks, most likely, before being erased and used again.<p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>News organizations have frequently requested such video, and gotten it, from government.  If government has recorded the video tape, this would fall under the regular FOI or FOIA requestâ€¦whether from state or federal agency. Generally if government has recorded the video, and it is not part of criminal investigation or meets some exception to the law, it should be available. </p>   

<p>If the question is about private security cameras, then there is no right of access under those laws.  Oftentimes police agencies will get camera video from private entities and ask media to air it  to help identify a person, etc.   BCF</p>


<p>Hope that helps.</p>
